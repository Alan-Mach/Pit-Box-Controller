Parts Needed:
- Raspberry Pi Pico 
- 18 Choc v1 switches
- 4 M2.5 12mm screws
- 4 M2.5 threaded inserts
    - You could also screw directly into the plastic.
- 4 M2 4mm screws

Tools Needed:
- 3D printer
    - Must have a build plate of at least 220mm x 220mm
- Soldering iron (and associated tools, like solder, flux, etc.)

## Wiring
![Wiring_Guide](/pictures/Wiring_Guide.jpg)
- Black indicates ground. It does not matter how each switch is grounded or how many switches are wired to a ground pin, just that every switch has a route to ground.

## Firmware
The instructions for installing the firmware can be found at the official [GP2040-CE website](https://gp2040-ce.info/installation/).

## Printing
Buttons:
The files for the arcade buttons will not be provided as they are standard 24mm and 30mm buttons, and many files already exist online.

Menu Buttons: 
The menu buttons follow the same dimensions as standard Choc V1 keyboard keycaps (16.5mm x 17.5mm).

The rest of the parts can be printed as they are. The horizontal expansion in the slicer settings may have to be modified so that the switches fit properly.
